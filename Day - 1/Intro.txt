    Let's take one scenario,
    In which we are having daily assignments 
    and each day there is new assignments
    so whenever the new assignments arrives we store that assignments as follow condition:
        the new assignment must contains previous assignments signature + it's own content and finally we shared new assignment signature.
    Thus, all students sharing the same key if not than we have to tell that student to replace your data with correct key.
